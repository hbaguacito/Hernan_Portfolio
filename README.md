# Hernan Aguacito's Analytics Portfolio

## About Me
Hi! I'm Hernan Aguacito, a budding data analyst with a passion for using data to solve real-world problems. I’m currently a Master's student exploring analytics through projects that blend statistical analysis, research, and actionable insights. This portfolio showcases my work in data analysis, visualization, and research.

## Purpose
This repository is my analytics portfolio, where I share projects I’ve completed to demonstrate my skills in data analysis, statistical testing, and communication of findings. Expect to see a mix of academic and personal projects here!

## Featured Project: Bloodlines - Strengthening Australia's Blood Donation Network
- **Objective**: To identify factors influencing blood donation behavior in Australia and recommend strategies for improving donor recruitment.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Psychological barriers like fear of needles don’t significantly affect donation intentions, but lack of awareness does.
  - Personalized communication (e.g., direct mail, phone calls) outperforms mass media in motivating donors.
  - Family encouragement significantly boosts donation intentions.
- **Impact**: Offers actionable insights for organizations like the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood to enhance blood supply campaigns.
- **Details**: Surveyed 276 participants, analyzed with Chi-square tests, t-tests, ANOVA, and regression in SPSS. Full report available [here](path/to/your/project/file.pdf).

## How to Navigate
- All projects are stored in the `projects` folder (or will be as I add more!).
- Each project includes a report (PDF) and, where applicable, analysis code or datasets.
- Check out the featured project section above for a quick dive into my work.
